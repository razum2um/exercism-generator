(require '[exercism-generator.core :refer :all])

(->> input test-cases-forms (take 2) (apply print-test-forms) println)
;;=> (ns series-test
;;=>   (:require [clojure.test :refer [deftest is testing]]
;;=>             [series :refer [slices]]))
;;=>
;;=> (deftest slices-of-one-from-one
;;=>   (testing "slices of one from one"
;;=>     (is (= ["1"] (slices "1" 1)))))

(run-tests-with-example input example)
;;=> Ran 10 tests in 0.038 seconds
;;=> 10 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors.
;;=> {:test 10, :pass 10, :fail 0, :error 0, :type :summary, :duration 38.478862}
